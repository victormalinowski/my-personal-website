    <h3>Confounded Logic</h3>

      To mentally escape your surroundings, you begin to daydream about walking in the park on a 
      warm summer day enjoying some tasty ice cream, but you notice this thought elicits fear 
      rather than comfort. You recently took up statistics as a hobby and are frightened to 
      discover that an increase in drowning incidents occurs roughly at the same time as an 
      increase in ice cream consumption. Formally, we would say that ice cream consumption is 
      <i>associated</i> with drowning; however, it would be absurd to conclude that ice cream 
      consumption <i>causes</i> drowning, or vice versa. Here, an attentive observer may interject 
      that both ice cream consumption and drowning occur most frequently in the summer, a time 
      where people reach for a beach towel or a tasty treat to cool off from the sweltering heat. 
      In this case, the summer weather is known as a <i>confounder</i>, that is, something that 
      disrupts our attempt to establish a causal link between ice cream consumption and drowning.

    <h3>
      Propensity Scores
    </h3>

      This situation is an extreme example of the challenges statisticians face when attempting to 
      perform <i>causal inference</i>, that is, determining whether a certain <i>treatment</i> 
      causes a certain <i>outcome</i>. Luckily, you are now an intermediate-level statistician, and
      you know just the trick to perform effective causal inference. Returning to the example from 
      above, you see that people consume ice cream more often in the summer than in the winter, 
      hence you say the summer has a higher <i>propensity score</i> of ice cream consumption than 
      the winter. You group people by propensity score, that is, separate them into summer and 
      winter groups, and observe that any association between ice cream consumption and drowning 
      <i>within</i> these groups melts away. Phew! However, propensity score methods are effective 
      only if the confounders can be measured. Unfortunately, we usually cannot measure confounders
      as simply as taking the air temperature.

      Complicated Situations

      Suppose you have now become an advanced statistician, perhaps even a Nobel Prize laureate 
      like <a href='https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/' target='_blank' 
      title="Information about David Card">David Card</a>. You are the face of <i>Econometrica</i>,
      and can command regression to model anything you want. The year is 1993, and you are 
      <a href='https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w4483/w4483.pdf' target='blank' 
      title="Card's 1993 paper on the topic">attempting to determine</a> how a person's years of 
      education impacts his or her income. You account for all the usual confounders: age, sex, 
      ethnicity, so on and so forth using propensity score methods. You think you have it all 
      figured out, but then something catches your attention: a person's intelligence will surely 
      be a confounder since it impacts both years of education and income! Unfortunately, there is 
      no universally accepted way of measuring intelligence; however, this inconvenience does not 
      deter you.

    <h3>
      Instrumental Variables
    </h3>

      You notice that children living closer to college are more likely to enroll in higher 
      education than those living further away. However, since childhood college proximity is 
      <i>randomized</i>, that is, not influenced by the child, the increase in income associated 
      with closer college proximity can be directly attributed to the increase in years of 
      education rather than intelligence. Perfect! You found an <i>instrumental variable</i>, that
      is, something which allows you to circumvent intelligence levels and conclude that an 
      increase in years of education does indeed <i>cause</i> an increase in income. In general 
      settings, instrumental variables are powerful tools that can randomize treatment to diminish
      the disruptiveness of unmeasured confounders, allowing us to directly conclude whether the 
      treatment causes the outcome.
