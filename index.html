      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Victor! I am an undergrad student at the University of Waterloo currently
        majoring in biostatistics. My main area of study consists of probability theory,
        statistical inference, and forecasting techniques; however, I have a broad range of other
        interests both inside and outside of mathematics.
      </p>

        Early in my undergraduate career, I had the opportunity to get acquainted with R Markdown
        during an introductory data analysis course. From there I began exploring other markup
        languages such as LaTeX and HTML, which led to the creation of this website. In the
        future, I would like to learn more about epidemiology and sampling theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not studying math, I like learning about history, geography, and astronomy. I also   
        enjoy hiking, cycling, and watching sports. You may wish to view my current <a href=
