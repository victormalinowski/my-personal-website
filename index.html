    <p>
      Hi, I'm Victor! I am a graduate mathematics student at the University of Waterloo studying biostatistics. From an early age, I always enjoyed 
      learning about math and science, which inspired me to seek opportunities to refine my abilities within these disciplines. In grade school I 
      often participated in math competitions to develop my problem solving skills. Despite statistics being my primary area of study, I like 
      exploring many other topics including history, geography, and astronomy.

      Early in my undergrad career, I had the opportunity to acquaint myself with R Markdown during an introductory data analysis course. From 
      there I began exploring other markup languages such as LaTeX and HTML, which led to the creation of this website. After deciding to major in 
      biostatistics, I began studying stochastic processes, generalized linear models, time series analysis, experimental design, sampling theory, 
      and life history analysis in greater detail.

      From May 2022 to December 2022, I had the chance to work at Statistics Canada as a methodology co-op student. During my time at StatCan, I 
      first used hierarchical linear models to complete a well-being study under the General Social Survey, after which I moved to the agriculture 
      section to complete various innovation projects. I graduated with distinction from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Mathematics in 
      2023, and began pursuing a Master of Mathematics at the same university later that year.
