      <p>
        Hi, I'm Victor! I am an undergrad student at the University of Waterloo currently
        majoring in biostatistics. My main area of study consists of probability theory and
        statistical inference; however, I have a broad range of other interests both inside 
        and outside of mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been continually refining my math abilities since early grade school, and I have 
        always enjoyed partaking in school
        <a href='https://www.therecord.com/news/waterloo-region/2018/05/23/mathletes-say-their-sport-is-everything.html' 
        title="My final contest">competitions</a>. Early in my undergraduate career, I had the 
        opportunity to get acquainted with R Markdown during an introductory data analysis course. 
        From there I began exploring other markup languages such as LaTeX and HTML, which led to 
        the creation of this website. In the future, I would like to learn more about epidemiology 
        and sampling theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not studying math, I like learning about history, geography, and astronomy. I also   
        enjoy hiking, cycling, and watching sports. You may wish to view my current <a href=
