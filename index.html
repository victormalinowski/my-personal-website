      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Victor! I am an undergrad student at the University of Waterloo currently
        majoring in biostatistics. My main area of study consists of probability theory,
        statistical inference, and forecasting techniques; however, I have a broad range of other
        interests both inside and outside of mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early in my undergraduate career, I had the opportunity to get acquainted with R Markdown
        during an introductory data analysis course. From there I began exploring other mark-up
        languages such as LaTeX and HTML, which led to the creation of this website. In the
        future, I plan to learn more about real analysis and stochastic processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not studying math, I like learning about history, geography, and astronomy. I also
        enjoy hiking, cycling, and watching sports. If you would like to contact me, please send
        an email to <a href='mailto:vmmalino@uwaterloo.ca' title="My university email address">
        vmmalino@uwaterloo.ca</a>. You may also wish to view my <a href='resume.pdf' title=

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently in the process of refining my LaTeX skills by composing a workbook with
        practice problems for Calculus I - Calculus III; however, I have made little substantive
        progress as of yet. I will update this section when possible.
